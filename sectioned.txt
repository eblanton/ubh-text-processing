This file has a preamble with some arbitrary text in it.  After this
preamble, there will be the keyword BEGIN, then some other text, then
the keyword END.  Some of our commands will change only the text
between those keywords.

BEGIN
Hi, I'm elb and I'm here to talk to you about text processing.

We're going to see a lot of different tools for that task!  Some of
them may be familiar to you, and some of them may be new, but I'm
guessing some of the techniques will be surprising.
END

The file closes out with some more text.
